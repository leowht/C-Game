to compile on windows do the following : 

go to the root of the project
run "cmake -S . -B build/ -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"" (i think)
run "cmake --build build/ --config Debug"

go in the build/Debug file, there should be a Frodo.exe
run Frodo.exe

if nothing happens, copy and paste the files in the /files folder and add them in the same folder as Frodo.exe

".\build\Debug\Frodo.exe" to run the program
